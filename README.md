# E-commerce Back End
# Description
  This project is a concise example of the back-end architecture of an E-commerce platform. It is written in node and uses the packages: MySQL2 to access the database, Sequlize to act as the ORM between the database and the server, and dotenv to handle environment variables. Insomnia was used to test the endpoints.
